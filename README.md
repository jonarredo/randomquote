# randomquote

## Purpose Of This
This is the first project from codecademy that I am doing on my own.
I am also taking this time to practice my markdown on the README.md file.

### Randomquote project
The purpose of this project is to:  
1. Use VS Code, Command Line, Git and Github.
2. Practice planning and pushing a project to github.
3. Practice your markdown skills.
4. Practice javascript.
5. Running node locally.

## Running The Code
After downloading this code to your own folder
run `node randomquote.js`  on the path of file in the command line
and receive a silly quote generated.
